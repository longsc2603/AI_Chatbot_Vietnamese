# AI Vietnamese Chatbot
A Facebook Messenger AI Chatbot using Vietnamese

You can check out the details of how to run the chatbot via Facebook Messenger in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/longsc2603/AI_messenger_chatbot)

This repository is an updated version and is used for Vietnamese. In here there still are the simple Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models .

I also fine-tune the PhoBERT model on the dataset about DUT FAST Faculty Students.

(Pho is Phá»Ÿ, for those who do not know)
