# AI Vietnamese Chatbot
A Facebook Messenger AI Chatbot using Vietnamese

You can check out the details of how to run the chatbot via Facebook Messenger in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/longsc2603/AI_messenger_chatbot)

This repository is an updated version of that one and is used for Vietnamese. In here there still are the simple Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models .

I also fine-tune the PhoBERT model on the dataset about DUT FAST Faculty Students.

(Pho is Phá»Ÿ, for those who do not know)

Here is a link to my personal Facebook Page Chatbot for you to check out, use the Frequently Asked Question given in the chat if you are new to get the hang of what information the chatbot can provide:

**Update 25/6/2022: As I no longer test the bot, Facebook has revoked the page_messaging permit for this page, so now you cannot test it yourself anymore, sorry!**
**You can still follow this repo to build your own bot though.**
